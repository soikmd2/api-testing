This content is designed for QAs who want to master the skills of API testing to ensure the reliability, security, and performance of APIs. Through a mix of theory and practical exercises, students will learn how to plan, execute, and automate API tests using industry-leading tools. By the end of the course, participants will have a comprehensive understanding of API testing concepts and hands-on experience applying them in real-world scenarios.


## What Youâ€™ll Learn and How You Can Apply It
- Understand the fundamentals of APIs and their role in software systems.
- Identify different types of API testing and select the appropriate approach for various use cases.
- Create effective API test cases, considering edge cases, performance, and security.
- Utilize tools like Postman and REST Assured for API testing and automation.
- Integrate API testing into CI/CD pipelines to improve development workflows.
- Apply learned skills in real-world projects to ensure API quality, scalability, and robustness.
